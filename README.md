# Risk Assessment Tool for AI Act

See https://harshp.com/ai_act_risk/

This implementation is by Harshvardhan J. Pandit based on the below work. It uses the [Notation3 language](https://w3c.github.io/N3/reports/20230703) to express information and rules to derive inferences entirely in-browser/client-side using the [EYE-js](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye-js) reasoner. 

The original tool is available at: https://regtech.adaptcentre.ie/highrisk
